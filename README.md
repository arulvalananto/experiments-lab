# Experimentation Lab

A hands-on lab for designing, building, and evaluating backend systems, infrastructure components, and distributed system patterns used in real-world production environments.

This repository is not a collection of tutorials.  
It is a **deliberate experimentation space** to explore *how things work*, *why they work*, and *when they fail*.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this lab is to:

- Experiment with **different architectural styles**
- Build **modular backend components**
- Explore **communication patterns** and **integration strategies**
- Understand **trade-offs, bottlenecks, and failure modes**
- Learn by **building real, minimal, focused systems**

Each experiment is scoped, intentional, and documented.
